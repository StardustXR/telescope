# telescope
See the stars! Easy Stardust setups to run on your computer.

## AppImage
The appimages that are built will automatically be put in releases. `build_appimage.sh` is only for ubuntu 24.04 and for github CI.

## Nix flakes
There's a nix flake for NixOS only that builds the whole thing. If you can get it to bundle with GL/Vulkan for other distros, please PR!

## Scripts
For distro packages that contain telescope (AUR and Terra) the scripts are provided. Install both to $PATH somewhere.
